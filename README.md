## **Lab 2**

### Question 1 (Tutorial 1 -- Q3)

The perimeter of a rectangular fence is known. If the width of the fence
is Â¾ the size of the length of the fence.

Write a Java program to determine the width and length of the fence.

**Hint:** Perimeter of a Rectangle = 2 * (length + width)

### Question 2 (Tutorial 1 -- Q4)

A rope is used to create a square fence. The length of a side of the
square is known. Later this same rope is used to create a circular
fence.

Write a Java program to find the radius of the circular fence.

  </p>

**Hint:**
- Perimeter of a Square = 4 * length
- Circumference of Circle = 2 * PI * Radius
- PI = 22/7

###  Question 3

Write a Java program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle when two other sides are known.

**Hint:** Hypotenuse = square root (SideA^2 + SideB^2)
