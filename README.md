> Question 1 (Tutorial 1 -- Q3)\
> The perimeter of a rectangular fence is known. If the width of the
> fence is Â¾ the size of the length of the fence.
>
> Write a Java program to determine the width and length of the fence.
>
> *\*Hint: Perimeter of a Rectangle = 2 \* (length + width)*

> A rope is used to create a square fence. The length of a side of the
> square is known. Later this same rope is used to create a circular
